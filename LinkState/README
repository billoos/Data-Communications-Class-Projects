The design of my project is split up into two classes
LinkState class is main class that takes in the file and sourceNode
LinkState also reades the file with number of nodes first and then puts all information in a matrix
Then link state calls method dijkstra in shortestpath class that deals with finding shortest path and printing it in console

When building my solution I changed the command directory to file with LinkState.java ShortestPath.java and network.dat(or whatever testing file)
Then I used javac LinkState and then java LinkState fileName sourceNodeId
fileName is file wanted to be tested and sourceNodeId is whatever the source node is

The time complexity of this soultion is O(n^2)

Dijkstra method in shortestpath loops through numNodes-1 with a loop inside numNodes
